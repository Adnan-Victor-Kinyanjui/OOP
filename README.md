# 🍳 Recipe Finder — Java + React (OOP Mini Project)

## 📘 Overview
Recipe Finder is a **full-stack web application** built using **Java (Spring Boot)** for the backend and **React + Vite** for the frontend.  
It helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they already have, showing which ingredients are missing and updating used ones.

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in both Java and JavaScript, while integrating **RESTful APIs** and **frontend-backend communication**.
